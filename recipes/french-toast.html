    <p>Quick and easy French toast with ingredients in your pantry</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>Pinch kosher salt</li>
        <li>Pinch ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>Pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>8 slices white bread</li>
        <li>Maple syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 200Â°F. If using very fresh, moist bread, arrange slices in a single layer on the rack and cook in oven, turning once, until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla until thoroughly combined. Add milk and whisk to blend.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat, swirling skillet, until foaming subsides, about 5 minutes. Soak 2 slices of bread in egg bath, turning, until saturated. Add soaked bread to skillet and cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on bottom side, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle top side of bread with sugar, flip, and continue to cook, swirling occasionally, until browned on second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer French toast to the rack in the oven in a single layer to keep warm and repeat with remaining slices of bread and egg bath.</li>
        <li>Serve French toast with pats of butter and maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>
