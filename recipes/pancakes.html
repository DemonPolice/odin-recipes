        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These pancakes are extra light and fluffy with a classic buttery flavor and golden brown, crisp tops and bottoms</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic Dry Pancake Mix</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>10 oz all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Each Batch of Pancakes</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 large eggs, separated</li>
                    <li>1.5 cups buttermilk</li>
                    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
                    <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted, plus more for serving</li>
                    <li>Warm maple syrup</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>For the Dry Pancake Mix:</strong> Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until homogenous. Transfer to an airtight container. The mix will stay good for 3 months. (See notes.)</li>
            <li><strong>For each Batch of Pancakes:</strong> Place one batch of dry mix in a large bowl. In a medium clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, buttermilk, and sour cream until homogenous. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking. Carefully fold in the egg whites with a rubber spatula until just combined. Pour the mixture over the dry mix and fold until just combined (there should still be plenty of lumps).</li>
            <li>Heat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle). Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. Use a 1/4-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in the skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. Serve the pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and butter.</li>
